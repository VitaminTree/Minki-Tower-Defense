# At some point, every relevant resource that's tied to the "player" should probably be in here.
# This includes but is not limited to:
#  - Inventory
#  - Money
#  - Wave progress
#  - Health
#  - Experience? Idk
#
# For now, this script will remain empty until the next realease is shipped, then I may consider refactoring
